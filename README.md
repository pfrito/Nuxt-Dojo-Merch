# Nuxt Dojo Merch
## Description

A website that simulates an e-commerce site for clothing items. It is implemented with Nuxt 3 and Tailwind CSS for styling. It implements a lot of the advantages of the Nuxt framework such as pages, route parameters, layouts, reusable components, error pages, server routes and much more. **I hope it will be helpful!**
